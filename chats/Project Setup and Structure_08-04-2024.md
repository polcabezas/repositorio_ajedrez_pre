# Project Setup and Structure Conversation Log (08-04-2024)

## Summary
This chat covers the initial setup of the chess project repository, including virtual environment activation, pip update, `.gitignore` configuration, and the creation of the basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) file structure based on the rules provided in `@main_rules.mdc`.

## Key Steps Taken:
1.  **Virtual Environment Activation:** Activated the `.venv` using `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.
2.  **Pip Update:** Updated pip to the latest version using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
3.  **.gitignore Configuration:** Added standard Python ignore patterns (including `.venv`, `__pycache__`, build artifacts, IDE folders, testing cache) to the `.gitignore` file. Confirmed `.env` was already present.
4.  **MVC Structure Creation:**
    *   Created main directories: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`.
    *   Created core files: `main.py`, `models/__init__.py`, `models/game_state.py`, `models/board.py`, `models/piece.py`, `models/move_validator.py`, `views/__init__.py`, `views/gui_view.py`, `controllers/__init__.py`, `controllers/game_controller.py`.
    *   Added docstrings explaining the purpose of each created file.
5.  **Piece File Creation:** Created individual files for each chess piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) within `models/pieces/`, each with a basic docstring.
